My personal repository for Advent of Code 2021.
This repo will be made public at some point after completion, in order to have my solutions saved/shareable with peers.

My goal this year is to have something for each day, at least a silver star.
If I can, I would like to gold star each day. And then extra-extra on top would be finding optimal time complexity solutions.
